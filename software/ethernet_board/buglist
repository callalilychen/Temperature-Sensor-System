if one unplugs ALL boards at some specific moment,
ethernet board goes into a weird state: "start! is always printed out very fast
bus is then somehow locked, a twi command (like scan) will freeze the ui
IDEA:
	This looks like a twi mutex deadlock
Analysis:
	-> it was a deadlock, which happened when 0 boards were connected.
	-> after fixing the deadlock, i could not reproduce a problem
	   when randomly unplugging boards.
