if one unplugs ALL boards at some specific moment,
ethernet board goes into a weird state: "start! is always printed out very fast
bus is then somehow locked, a twi command (like scan) will freeze the ui
IDEA:
	This looks like a twi mutex deadlock
Analysis:
	-> it was a deadlock, which happened when 0 boards were connected.
	-> after fixing the deadlock, i could not reproduce a problem
	   when randomly unplugging boards.
-> marked fixed

ERROR is displayed, when connecting humidity board.
-> this seems to be an error in collector board chescksum validation

---

Feature request:
	command for led control via netcat user interface
  -> would allow easy tracking of boards:
	"what is board with address xxx"

Sending to couch db
Open Questions:
	- What do we send to DB?
	  -> only valid packets?
		-> one document for each sensor?
